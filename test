I am going to be going to Texas A&M  for a couple years.  I think that I will
be able to be doing something better than all of this stuff right now.

Can you please just come over here and be trying to be doing soemthing taht you
really don't care about right now.

I need to set aside a couple ground rules.


I am going to enroll at Texas A&M.

I am going to live in a 2 bedroom apartment that I am going to rent out the 2nd
bedroom to someone else for $400/month  halfsies on internet and other utilities.


Preferrably
